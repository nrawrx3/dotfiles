Beauty has many aspects, of course, and is in the eye of the beholder. Some
theorems and algorithms are beautiful to me because they have many different
applications; some because they do powerful things with severely limited
resources; some because they involve aesthetically pleasing patterns; some
because they have a poetic purity of concept.
