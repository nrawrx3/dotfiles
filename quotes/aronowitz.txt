The so-called ‘middle class’ achieve their priveleged access to consumption and
security through education, in which they are obliged to invest a substantial
part of their income, acquireing as their property a degree which represents the
sorry fact that ‘the candidate can tolerate boredom and knows how to follow the
rules.’
