Mental health is based on a certain degree of tension, the tension between
what one has already achieved and what one still ought to accomplish, or the
gap between what one is and what one should become. Such a tension is inherent
in the human being and therefore is indispensable to mental well-being. We
should not, then, be hesitant about challenging man with a potential meaning
for him to fulfill. It is only thus that we evoke his will to meaning from its
state of latency. I consider it a dangerous misconception of mental hygiene to
assume that what man needs in the first place is equilibriumâ€¦a tensionless
state. What man actually needs is not a tensionless state but rather the
striving and struggling for a worthwhile goal, a freely chosen task. What he
needs is not the discharge of tension at any cost but the call of a potential
meaning waiting to be fulfilled by him... If architects want to strengthen a
decrepit arch, they increase the load which is laid upon it, for thereby the
parts are joined more firmly together.
