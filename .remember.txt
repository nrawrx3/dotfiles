Remember this!!!!!!!!

Please save files in the following places.

Most text files go in the ~/text directory.

For code, if it is a git repo and contains mostly text, it goes to
text/code_repos. If it contains many binary files, it goes to mixed/code_repos.

All builds must be done in ~/builds or ~/build directory.

All mixed stuff goes in the ~/mixed directory.

All documents like PDF, PPT, etc. go in ~/reads in the appropriate directory.

All python virtual environments go in the ~/venvs directory.

All manual dotfiles, text as well as binary go in ~/dotfiles and symlinked.

~/dotfiles is itself symlinked to ~/gits/dotfiles.

Some mixed configuration can be placed in ~/mixed/configs and symlinked.

Git projects will go to ~/gits. The 'origin' remote of ~/gits/<project_name> is
the url of the project. The 'hsb' remote is for $HSB/gits/<project_name> dir.

Aur and general pkgbuilds go in ~/aur.
