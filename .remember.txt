Welcome!

Please save files in the following places.

All text files go in the ~/text directory.

For code, if it is a git repo and contains mostly text, it goes to
text/code_repos. If it contains many binary files, it goes to mixed/code_repos.

All builds must be done in ~/builds directory.

All mixed stuff goes in the ~/mixed directory.

All python virtual environments go in the ~/venvs directory.

All manual dotfiles, text as well as binary go in ~/dotfiles and symlinked.

Some mixed configuration can be placed in ~/mixed/configs and symlinked.
